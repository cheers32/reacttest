// even though not required, it's recommended to use JSX instead of react function calls like React.createElement()
// browsers don't know JSX, so JSX converted by Babel to JS
// create a react component, function or a class
// the None is "undefined" in JS

// with {{}} syntax, it means {} is a JS variable reference, then 2nd {} is a JS object with {key: 'value', key2: 'value2'} style
// this is called JSX interpolation:
// define variable: const myVar = 'hi';
// define function: function myFunc() {return 'hello';}, this function call can be used as a variable. this is not JS syntax, but JSX syntax to refer to JS variable
// cannot reference a JS object directly, can refer its value by using key
// use className instead of class for inline style; use "htmlFor" instead of "for"
// object can be used in style, but cannot use as text

// take react component and show it on the screen

// fetch() is a JS function that make a web call
// window scope if using console in a website
